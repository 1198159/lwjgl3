### 3.1.2

_Not Released Yet_

This build includes the following changes:

#### Bindings

- Added [OpenVR](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr) bindings.
- Added [Tiny OpenEXR](https://github.com/syoyo/tinyexr) bindings.
- Added [Yoga](https://facebook.github.io/yoga/) bindings.
- bgfx: Updated to API version 39 (up from 34)
- jemalloc: Updated to 4.5.0 (up from 4.4.0)
- nuklear: Updated to 1.33.0 (up from 1.29.1, with the new versioning)
- stb
	* Updated `stb_dxt` to 1.0.6 (up from 1.0.4)
    * Updated `stb_easy_font` to 1.0 (up from 0.7)
    * Updated `stb_image` to 2.14 (up from 2.13)
    * Updated `stb_image_resize` to 0.93 (up from 0.91)
    * Updated `stb_image_write` to 1.05 (up from 1.02)
    * Updated `stb_perlin` to 0.3 (up from 0.2)
    * Updated `stb_rect_pack` to 0.11 (up from 0.10)
    * Updated `stb_truetype` to 1.15 (up from 1.12)
    * Updated `stb_vorbis` to 1.10 (up from 1.09)
- tinyfiledialogs: Updated to 2.8 (up from 2.7.2)
- Vulkan: Updated to 1.0.42 (up from 1.0.38)

#### Improvements

- `MemoryStack`: Increased default stack size to 64kb (up from 32kb)
- Shared library loading can now utilize a `ClassLoader` specified by the caller. (#277)
- Significantly reduced `DEBUG_MEMORY_ALLOCATOR` and `DEBUG_STACK` overhead in Java 9 using the new `StackWalker` API.

#### Fixes

- Assimp: Struct member nullability fixes
- Linux: Removed dependencies to newer GLIBC versions.
- LibOVR: Fixed layout of the `ovrInputState` struct.
- OpenAL: Removed buffer auto-sizing from `alcCaptureSamples`. The number of samples must now be specified explicitly, similar to `alcRenderSamplesSOFT`.
- Vulkan: Function addresses are now retrieved only once, using the optimal method for each function type.
    * This avoids warnings on pedantic validation layers.

### Breaking Changes

- Mapped more integer parameters and return values to Java `boolean`, that were missed while working on #181.
    * Xlib's `Bool`
    * OpenCL's `cl_bool`
    * DynCall's `DCbool`
- Moved JNI global reference functions from `MemoryUtil` to the generated `org.lwjgl.system.jni.JNINativeInterface`.
- The Vulkan capabilities have been separated into two classes: `VKCapabilitiesInstance` and `VKCapabilitiesDevice`.
    * Flags for core Vulkan versions exist in both classes.
    * Flags for instance extensions exist only in `VKCapabilitiesInstance`.
    * Flags for device extensions exist only in `VKCapabilitiesDevice`.
    * Functions that dispatch on `VkInstance` or `VkPhysicalDevice` exist only in `VKCapabilitiesInstance`.
    * Functions that dispatch on `VkDevice` and device-derived handles exist only in `VKCapabilitiesDevice`.
    * Bootstrapping functions can be retrieved with `VK.getFunctionProvider()`.
