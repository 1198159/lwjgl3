_Not Released Yet_

This build includes the following changes:

#### Bindings

- Added [Assimp](http://www.assimp.org/) bindings.
- bgfx: Updated to API version 32 (up from 28)
- jemalloc: Updated to version 4.3.1 (up from 4.2.1)

#### Improvements

- Linux: All natives are now built with GCC 6.2 (up from 4.8)
- Loader: If `jemalloc` initialization fails and `org.lwjgl.system.allocator` has not been set, a simple warning is now shown instead of an exception.
- Structs: Added bound checks to element accessors of array members.
- Generator: Validation is now required for all data pointer parameters. If validation is not possible, such parameters must be marked as potentially unsafe.  
- The SHA-1 hash of shared libraries is now included in the corresponding `natives` JAR files.
- The upstream git revision used to build shared libraries is now included in the corresponding `natives` JAR files.

#### Fixes

- Fixed loader diagnostics when `System.loadLibrary` fails. 

#### Breaking Changes

- A small number of method signatures have changed because of auto-size transformations that were missing in previous releases.
