- Added [Zstandard](http://facebook.github.io/zstd/) bindings.
- bgfx: Updated to API version 55 (up from 48)
- glfw: Updated to pre-release 3.3.0 version (up from 3.3.0 pre-release):
    * Support for transparent window framebuffers (`GLFW_TRANSPARENT_FRAMEBUFFER` window hint)

#### Improvements

- Replaced `Automatic-Module-Name` with explicit JPMS modules.
    * Enables applications using LWJGL to be bundled in custom run-time images with the `jlink` tool.
- lmdb: Significantly improved incremental growth performance on Windows.
    * Granularity of mapped memory commits increased from `4KB` (page size) to `2MB`.
    * This is an unofficial patch of `ITS#8324`.

#### Fixes

- EGL: Fixed nullability of `eglMakeCurrent` arguments.
- OpenVR: Fixed mapping of Vulkan forward declarations.
- Fixed native library resource discovery when running LWJGL as JPMS modules.
- Fixed invalid size calculation in `<StructType>.malloc(capacity)` methods.
- Fixed `MemoryStack` debugging when a try-with-resources block does not inline the call to `AutoCloseable::close`.
    * Supports Java 9 try-with-resources, which generates a synthetic `$closeResource` method.
    * Supports Kotlin's `T.use`, which uses the `kotlin.AutoCloseable::closeFinally` extension function.
- Fixed build number lookup from the jar manifest.
