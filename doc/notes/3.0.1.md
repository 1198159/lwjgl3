_Not Released Yet_

This build includes the following changes:

**BINDINGS**

- Bindings have been split into modules and are available as separate artifacts. (#100)
- Added [LMDB](http://lmdb.tech/doc/) bindings.
- Added [Nuklear](https://github.com/vurtun/nuklear) bindings. (#101)
- Added [Tiny File Dialogs](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tinyfiledialogs/) bindings.

**IMPROVEMENTS**

- Removed buffer object binding checks. (#197)
- Optimized `strlen` methods used internally by LWJGL.
- Added support for stack allocations with custom alignment.
- Removed allocation functionality from read-only, externally managed structs.

**FIXES**

- Callback instances are now tracked when the `DEBUG_MEMORY_ALLOCATOR` option is enabled.
- Shared libraries that ship with LWJGL are now always preferred over system libraries.
- Fixed return type of functions that return pointer to boolean.
- stb_image: Fixed result auto-sizing of stbi_load* functions.
- Functions that deallocate memory no longer have Java array overloads.

**BREAKING CHANGES**

- xxHash: Added support for stack allocation of streaming hash state. Opaque handles have been replaced by the `XXH*State` structs.
- Mapped more integer parameters and return values to Java booleans, that were missed while working on #181.
