This build includes the following changes:

#### Bindings

- bgfx: Updated to API version 30 (up from 28)

- nuklear: Update to version 1.18 (up from 1.17)
- Vulkan: Updated to version 1.0.33 (up from 1.0.32)

#### Improvements

- Linux: All natives are now built with GCC 6.2 (up from 4.8)
- Loader: If `jemalloc` initialization fails and `org.lwjgl.system.allocator` has not been set, a simple warning is now shown instead of an exception.

- Generator: Validation is now required for all data pointer parameters. If validation is not possible, such parameters must be marked as potentially unsafe.  

#### Fixes

#### Breaking Changes

- macOS: LWJGL now requires macOS 10.9/Mavericks or later (up from 10.7/Lion)
- A small number of method signatures have changed because of auto-size transformations that were missing in previous releases.
