### 3.2.2

_Not Released Yet_

This build includes the following changes:

#### Bindings

#### Improvements

- LLVM: The bindings can now be used with LLVM/Clang version 5.0 or newer (down from 8.0).

#### Fixes

- Fixed building on Linux & macOS when the path to LWJGL's root directory is shallow. (#442)
- Core: Fixed race condition in callback deallocation when the debug allocator is enabled. (#444)
- Generator: Support `void()` in callback functions without parameters. 
- Assimp: Added missing members to various struct types.
- LLVM: `LLVMGetErrorMessage` now returns `ByteBuffer` instead of `String`, so that `LLVMDisposeErrorMessage` can be used.
- OpenGL: Added `GL_DRAW_INDIRECT_BUFFER` overloads to `NV_bindless_multi_draw_indirect` & `NV_bindless_multi_draw_indirect_count` extensions.
